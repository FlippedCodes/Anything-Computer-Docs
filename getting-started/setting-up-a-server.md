Now click on your Server, and click on Files. Click upload and upload your bot File. After you uploaded the bot file make sure that the Server will start this file. For this go in the Panel on Startup and make sure that for JS the "Bot Js File", for Java "", for Python has the name of your uploaded bot.

We are always using the newest version of the programming language you selected, but you can change them by changing the Docker Image. If you are using Python or JavaScript you can install the packages by setting for python: "Additional Python Packages" or upload an requirements.txt or for JavaScript: "Additional Node Packages".

To start your server go back to Console and click "Start"
